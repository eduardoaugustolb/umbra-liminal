usage() {
    cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: install.sh [options] [phase...]

Options:
  -n, --dry-run     show what it would do without touching anything
  -y, --yes         never ask (for unattended runs)
      --copy        copy the configs instead of symlinking them
      --link        symlink the configs into the repo (default)
      --lang es|en|pt-BR  what the desktop speaks (default es; it asks if you do not
                    say, and Settings changes it later anyway)
  -h, --help        this

Phases (if you name none, all of them run in this order):
  base        preflight checks: Arch, network, sudo, not-root
  aur         builds yay if it is missing
  packages    installs pacman.txt + extra.txt + aur.txt
  repos       clones oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k and the zsh plugins
  config      puts home/ into your $HOME (symlinks or copies, with backup)
  system      copies system/etc into /etc  (asks for sudo)
  graphics    detects the graphics card(s) and installs their drivers
  services    enables what is in packages/services.txt
  sddm        installs the hyprisland login theme  (asks for sudo)
  spicetify   injects the theme into Spotify  (asks for sudo once)
  final       fonts, default shell, groups, first pywal palette, sprites

Separate phase, only if you name it:
  restore     undoes 'config': removes the symlinks to the repo and puts
              back whatever was there before, from ~/.dotfiles-backup

Examples:
  ./install.sh -n                 see the whole plan without running it
  ./install.sh --lang en          bring the desktop up in English
  ./install.sh config             just lay the dotfiles down again
  ./install.sh packages services  only packages and services
  ./install.sh restore            go back to how things were

Separate diagnostics:
  ./diagnose                      says what is missing or will not start, read-only

# ABSOLUTE path, and it has to: kitty's `include`, the GTK and
# satty `@import url(file://...)`, hyprlock's lock background... none of them
# expand `~` or `$HOME`, so a relative path would be resolved against whatever
# directory the program happened to start in. On diego's machine that absolute
# path is right by definition; on anyone else's it points at a home that does
# not exist, and the result is a desktop that comes up in default colours with
# nothing failing out loud.
#
# It was worse than colours: `sddm-hyprisland/install.sh` had its own source
# directory hardcoded, so the whole `sddm` phase died with "cannot stat
# /home/diego/.config/sddm-hyprisland/Main.qml", and
# `luminous-autoselect.service` pointed its ExecStart at a binary under
# /home/diego that is not there.
#
# This runs at the START of `config`, before anything is deployed, so every
# phase after it -system, services, sddm, final- sees files that already say
# the right thing. It rewrites the repo tree itself, which is deliberate and

# On a machine with more than one card, tells Hyprland which one to render on.

# finds and makes the FIRST one the primary renderer. On the tower that can
# easily be the Ryzen's integrated Radeon, even though both monitors hang off
# the RTX 5070 -- and then every frame is drawn on the iGPU and copied across to
# the NVIDIA card. That multi-GPU path is where the flicker, the stutter and the
# black screens live, especially with NVIDIA.
#
# WHAT IT WRITES. AQ_DRM_DEVICES, which is a PRIORITY LIST and not a lock: every
# card stays in it, just with the one that has the screens first. Plug a monitor
# into the other card later and it still lights up, as a secondary. On a machine
# with a single card this function does nothing at all, because there aquamarine
# has no choice to get wrong and setting the variable could only make it worse.

# means both the uwsm session and a plain hyprland.desktop one see it. The
# obvious places -- ~/.config/environment.d/ and ~/.config/uwsm/env -- are no
# good here: after the 'config' phase those directories are symlinks INTO THIS
